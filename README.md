# Beginner-Project-Excel-Tableau-
This is my first time with Excel and Tableau
# Wealth of Nations 🌍💷 - Data Analysis Project

## Project Overview 🎯

In this project, I utilised the **Wealth of Nations** dataset to showcase my data analysis skills. I began by **cleaning** and **manipulating the data in Excel**, ensuring the dataset was ready for further analysis. Following this, I used **Tableau** to create a dashboard that features key insights and visualisations. 

The aim of this project was to highlight my proficiency in both **Excel** and **Tableau**, especially with a focus on accessibility, as **colour-blind friendly** visuals were a requirement for the dashboard.

## Dataset Description 📂

The **Wealth of Nations** dataset provides economic, social, and demographic data for countries around the world. This data includes:

- **Country**: Name of the country 🏳️.
- **GDP per capita**: Economic output per person (USD) 💰.
- **Population**: Total population of each country 👥.
- **Life Expectancy**: Average lifespan at birth 👶➡️👵.
- **Schooling Years**: Average number of years in education 🎓.
- **Internet Users (%)**: Percentage of the population using the internet 🌐.
- **CO2 Emissions (metric tons per capita)**: Environmental impact data 🌳🛢️.
- **Region**: Geographic region of the country 🌍.

## Tools Used 🛠️

- **Excel**: For data cleaning and manipulation, including handling missing values and performing preliminary analysis.
- **Tableau**: For creating an interactive dashboard and visualising insights from the cleaned dataset, focusing on **colour-blind friendly** designs.

## Project Workflow 🔄

### 1. Data Cleaning and Manipulation (Excel) 🧹

I began by importing the dataset into **Excel** and performing the following tasks:

- **Handling Missing Data**: I cleaned up missing values and ensured consistency across the dataset.
- **Data Transformation**: Manipulated columns such as **GDP per capita**, **Life Expectancy**, and **Population** for easier analysis.
- **Sorting and Filtering**: I sorted the data by **GDP per capita**, and filtered it to focus on the **top 20 countries** by various metrics.

### 2. Visualisation and Dashboard Creation (Tableau) 📊

With the cleaned data ready, I imported it into **Tableau** and created the following visualisations for the **top 20 countries**:

- **Bar Chart**: Displaying the top 20 countries by **GDP per capita** 💵.
- **Scatter Plot**: Showing the relationship between **Life Expectancy** and **GDP per capita** 📈.
- **Choropleth Map**: Visualising **Internet Users (%)** across the top 20 countries 🗺️.
- **Bubble Chart**: Highlighting the correlation between **CO2 emissions** and **population** 🌍🏭.

The **Tableau dashboard** was designed with a colour-blind friendly palette to ensure accessibility and clarity for all users.

## Key Insights 💡

A few key insights from this analysis include:

- **Wealthier countries** (higher GDP per capita) tend to have **higher life expectancy** and greater access to the **internet**.
- There is a significant digital divide between countries, even among the top 20 wealthiest nations.
- Countries with larger populations tend to have higher **CO2 emissions**, but some high-income nations show disproportionately high emissions per capita.
